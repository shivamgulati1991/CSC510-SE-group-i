In this solution we will provide the user with a tool where he/she can enter the graduation requirements and also provide information about the different activities or courses completed till date. This tool takes these two set of information runs cross-validation to generate a to-do list which user has to complete in order to graduate on the target date.

We maintain user data in Database and use it in future log ins to track the progress made by user as user updates the data. This tool just gives you a single stop destination where you can come and check the things that needs to be done. 

User is responsible for updating the requirements in case anything change in course of time.

This tool maintains a database of the list of requirements for different courses and tracks. The user provide his or her information when he or she logs in for first time. The tool cross validates the requirements present in the database and shows user the list of things that needs attention and also recommends the ways of achieving the target. 

The database is maintained and updated to accomodate new requirements that can come up in course of time. This tool can be used to plan the roadmap of ones graduation and different options one have to go about it.
