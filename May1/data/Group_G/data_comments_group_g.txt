ident : 181952869,	user : cleebp,	text : Here are my thoughts on the ['Clipboard Manager'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clipboard%20Manager) plugin.

Install isn't too bad, you have to re-register your ctrl-c/ctrl-p (or for mac cmd-c/cmd-p) commands to use the managers commands. Once you are using their copies and pastes however it performs just like normal copy and paste; however, you can choose to show your history at the bottom of the screen like so:

![screen shot 2016-02-09 at 11 47 21 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3922117/12923245/fe09324c-cf22-11e5-8266-5f4126ec303f.png)

As you can see in the screenshot it handles indents through a special backslash, so while you can just fast copy from this box at the bottom if you want to preserve indents you must use their special commands for traversing the history and paste from that (an inconvenience). You can see where the history is currently pointed at from the big arrow on line 1.

Overall the plugin is nice but I don't like how it goes as far as to add a visual GUI component but you can only interact with it correctly through commands. This may be a larger problem with Sublime extensions on the whole though.

ident : 181956109,	user : cleebp,	text : Here are my thoughts on the ['Clipboard History'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clipboard%20History) plugin.

Install is way easier, don't have to remap commands it just works with your native ctrl-c/ctrl-v (or cmd-c/cmd-v) which is nice. Basically as you copy your history is build and by using a complex command (⌘⎇⌃V on mac) you can show your history and it appears in the command box at the top like so:

![screen shot 2016-02-09 at 11 55 27 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3922117/12923564/37b4404e-cf24-11e5-882f-e7fde47a60dd.png)

From here you can simply click an item and it will show up at your cursor location. Alternatively like the other plug-in you can use commands to navigate the history so your next paste pastes from the current  index. Unlike the other plugin your history doesn't stay visible as you work so you have to enter the command to see the history, then use commands to navigate and paste which is a huge pain.,	created_at : 1455037093.0,	issue : 13,	updated_at : 1455037644.0

ident : 181959636,	user : cleebp,	text : Here are my thoughts on the ['Jimbly's Clipboard History'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jimbly's%20Clipboard%20History) plugin.

So this just seems like a more updated version of the ['Clipboard History'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clipboard%20History) plugin with an easier command to access the clipboard history. But seriously besides that it seems identical on the surface level:

![screen shot 2016-02-09 at 12 04 34 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3922117/12923884/74bf74e4-cf25-11e5-8058-ce40b9c8555e.png)

Its last update was 8 months ago compared to the other plugins last update 3 years ago so really it just seems like the same project with a couple more recent tweaks. Same problem as before with the history not being static.

This is probably our best bet to start working from if we choose to go down the sublime route, my immediate changes to consider making would be:
- Making the history static, in other words have the history always be an active window, right now when you perform any action the history disappears 
- Having the history show automatically after first copy/paste
- Allow dragging from the history rather than just clicking to paste at cursor
- Provide contextual options on the history options, i.e. right-click on the item gives you options to delete it, favorite it, etc.
- Perhaps new display options with more context on where the item came from
- Flag items in the history as 'stickies' or 'favorites' so that they don't disappear
- add contextual options to the history window itself, i.e. right click on the window and there is an option to clear all non favorite items etc.,	created_at : 1455037590.0,	issue : 13,	updated_at : 1455037897.0

"atom.clipboard.write element" where element is "selectedText = @editor.getSelectedText()", so it is sort of making its own copy functionality, yet since that functionality is through the same keys as system copy, both its wrapper runs and the system copy runs.

ident : 187455387,	user : trueblue2704,	text : An interesting problem I just encountered:

Integrating the logging with the Atom extension code would result in only the stuff being copied from within Atom being logged, but having it separate would result in us losing information about what is being pasted since the clipboard is local to Atom.

One solution I have is to use a separate logger for logging copy and cut events (basically when the contents of the clipboard change), and having a separate logger that runs from within the extension. This would basically just be a block of code that writes to a file with the same information as the copy logger.

We could then merge the data, and sort based on the timestamp in order to get an accurate representation of how the extension is being used.

I'll have the block of code ready by the 24th, and we can spend the last few days integrating it to make sure it works fine.,	created_at : 1456188284.0,	issue : 18,	updated_at : 1456188284.0

You might want to take a look at https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html as well. It's what I'm using for the telemetry part so if you take a look at the code I've added to the telemetry, you should have an example on how to implement reading/writing to a file.

3. Add the readFile function call to the init method and then populate the clipboard, and call appendFile whenever you copy something so that it's stored in the file.

Hey guys, Dr. Menzies had something come up during our slot for the demo,

Fixed, took awhile to figure out how to do this haha.

Probably taking a break for now, I think the panel is in a good place, I wish I understood the way it displays better and how panels work to make it the full height of the panel, which would help with scrolling through items.

Some pre-requisites:

- Install the dependencies (They appear to be from the same package, so one install should work for both):
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20113456/installing-win32gui-python-module should help with that.
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15310121/trying-to-install-module-win32clipboard

Right now it just has basic information like subject's name, date, start/end time, which experiment is being conducted, etc. But it can be expanded to also include the check sheet for each of the tasks we will perform during the experiment.,	created_at : 1458151233.0,	issue : 55,	updated_at : 1458151233.0

ident : 197487942,	user : cleebp,	text : Okay so we have decided that the goal of each experiment will be to take a pretty empty project from the "clipboard-history" package, and eventually through a series of tasks build the final working "clipboard-history" package. Tasks will be designed to test specific things like copy/paste across windows, inside the same window, from outside sources, etc. so that we have a range of data points.

ALSO for each task we will build a spreadsheet detailing these metrics for that task so that we can come up with cool stats:
- Time to completion
- # windows switched between
- Errors?

By getting these stats we can then come up with some sort of ranking algorithm that will give us a concrete score for each package that will essentially tell us which was best (to answer that question). We will also have specific post surveys for each package so we can back up this score with user experiences.,	created_at : 1458154468.0,	issue : 55,	updated_at : 1458154468.0

Thoughts on stuff to get done today:

- Store the data we did end up collecting into the google sheet "experimental data". Right now that sheet is nearly empty (I just filled in some ideas on the organization, its hard to come up with a way to organize the data by participant and by task) so we will need to fill it out with relevant things to care about and fill it in with the data we collected.
- Document all of the issues we ran into when testing! This is important, we can use those issues as data points themselves in our paper, all data is data :D Not sure where the best place to do this is, maybe in an issue and then also in a google doc or something? We need something we can look at while writing the paper so the temporary existence of issues is an issue... haha... puns...

ident : 203589762,	user : cleebp,	text : Hey Ran since you are not in the meeting right now I'll just leave some notes here on the section you'll be writing...

So we gave you Results, and like the outline above shows (and the name says) this is where we will actually talk about the data from our experiments (by discrete results we just mean numeric results, see the "experimental data" excel sheet). Also compare results here and try to find interesting correlations (i.e. it took people ~4 tasks to learn the feature then all of their speeds increased). Finally make sure to include relevant tables and graphs from our data and reference them in your discussion.

Also just as a reminder the data is all in the "experimental data" google sheet on drive, there are 2 sheets and the second sheet is actually where the interesting data is because it shows times per task per feature.

Finally one last note is that the person I had for control/normal definitely tried way too hard to finish quickly so her data might throw some stuff off.

Also no need to specifically call out a best feature in your results section, as the discussion section will focus more on which feature was the best, etc.

The general outline of the report is as follows:
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Data collection
  - how did we collect our data
  - what was the process like of taking the data and converting it
  - I know the magic scripts did all this for us but we should walk through all the steps of what it did (that way they know we did more than just take a script and run)
  - Anonymization, how did it work
  - Talk about the multi user same user issue (like how it saw Ran as two users), and how we got around it
- Small Features Detection
  - bulk of our data reporting goes in this section
  - at this point these are just the small individual features we do stats on 
  - include graphs, figures, etc. REFERENCE THEM and talk about them, no phantom figures
  - "Define 10-20 feature extractors"
  - don't talk about combining these features into higher level bad smells yet, thats next section
- Bad Smell Detection
  - this isn't the early bad smell detector, rather its the bit about ranking all the groups for bad smells at the end of project 1
  - "combining the feature extractors, report on the bad smells"
  - so taking all of our little features we reported on, and combining them into more general bad smell categories and how the groups ranked on these.
- Early Bad Smell Detection
  - What method did we come up with detecting bad smells early
  - Test out our methods on project 1 data at different chronological points: "sort all our data chronologically and map out at what times (t1,t2,etc) these bad smells occur"

## Bad smells
* normal distribution (get mean and std deviation for each small feature)
1. progress: large variance, wait until the last minute
2. communication: insufficient communication(small mean value), One announcer--centralized
3. collaboration: lack of information on assignees, One person did all the work
4. effectiveness: unnecessary commits. no report on bug fixing

Effat if you could also upload your R scripts to the rstuff folder that would be really helpful, you can just add a folder called "scripts" inside rstuff where you drop your code. For example we don't understand your boxplot or what it means?

For features we have organized them into four categories each with their own features.

For our graphs we will create as many as we can for each feature; however, in our report we will only display 4 graphs at a time that have been trimmed to format nicely in the report. When we can include outliers in these display graphs that way we can discuss them. I'm pretty sure we can get R to do this or we can manually trim them and make graphics ourselves.

ident : 215821877,	user : cleebp,	text : Working on adding all the graphs as single images such that we can refer to the entire concept of a feature as a single figure (i.e. all 6 issue assignments pie charts are in the same image and figure that way Figure 6 is just "Figure 6: Issue Assignments").

I think this makes the most sense from an organizational and space standpoint, otherwise we will have like 70000 figures (lol), but it starts to look weird when the graphs are quite large, for example the barplots or linecharts.

From what I can tell this issue will only occur with "changes_per_commit", "commitPerWeek", and "issueComment".

Any ideas on how to get around this with our column format? We could just make individual figures for each group but that adds 18 figures (eek), for "changes_per_commit" I went ahead and made a full graphic with all 6 to show how it looks so you can check it out in the document.

- number of commits per week (progress)

I really like the linegraphs for the progress sections so those definitely need to stay, but for participants per issue (issueComment) we could also present this in a boxplot similar to issueNumComment.
