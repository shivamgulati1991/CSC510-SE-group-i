ident : 171391518,	user : cleebp,	text : Also a note on which version of Eclipse to download, there is a bundled version of Eclipse called, "Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers" and it has a whole set of tools already loaded into it that would make our lives easier. For example it has Git integration and something called the PDE which is the Plug-in Development Environment. Here is a link to that specific bundled version of Eclipse (not that the download links are on the right, not the big button at the top): http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-eclipse-committers-451/mars1

ident : 171416434,	user : reachspirit,	text : Here are some papers on code cloning. It turns out that code clone is quite different from our goal of an efficient clipboard manager. 
Clone management: Clone analysis tool with tag cloud visualization. Jump to the picture. It gives a description of the procedure of clone management.

Another paper on clone management. 
http://www.cs.usask.ca/~croy/papers/2011/Zibran_IWSC2011_Management.pdf
But these papers may help us understand cloning itself better. Although that's quite beyond the scope of this project, we know that we can do more with the clipboard.

UPDATE: It takes about half an hour to get a basic hello world extension running. It's pretty much the same set of steps from Eclipse document on using the PDE. Also if you're using Eclipse Neon (the latest version), the documentation has an error. "org.eclipse.ui.actionSets" is deprecated and is now "org.eclipse.ui.command".,	created_at : 1453151280.0,	issue : 2,	updated_at : 1453155629.0

Paper on 'A study of developer work habits'. (Cited by 367, from 2006) Section 5.4 and Table 3 specifically talk about 6 different types of code duplication (including copy and pasting) and have survey/interviews with developers on each of these times - interesting read and opens up other possibilities to consider for our plug-in, plus this was study based.

Another term I'm finding that could be worth investigating is 'Code Duplication' (covers more than just copy and pasting so we may get a different result of papers).,	created_at : 1453406043.0,	issue : 1,	updated_at : 1453406043.0

ident : 173699472,	user : trueblue2704,	text : Paper on Reverse Engineering Design Patterns in Java (cited by 188, from 2006): 
There are a few common design patterns which are the "best practices" to follow while coding. It's possible this would be out of scope for the extension, but something to consider is detecting whether code being pasted is one of these design patters. The paper talks about detecting these patterns.
