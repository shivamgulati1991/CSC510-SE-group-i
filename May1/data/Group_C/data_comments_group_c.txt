This is a book, not a paper. Let me read the following paper instead:
- Intelligent Email: Aiding Users with AI (Shijie),	created_at : 1453855116.0,	issue : 4,	updated_at : 1453855255.0

 - Decision Fusion (different models to predict different type of folders, then combine the prediction together)
 - attentive learning (3 type of folders: content-aware, time-aware, participant-aware)
 - has a lot of related work description
 - performance metric: average accuracy
 - Data source: Use the following in bash:

```
wget http://people.cs.umass.edu/~ronb/datasets/enron_flat.tar.gz

 - Clustering (unsupervised learning)
 - Labeling after clustering by using most common words in the subjects
 - Introduction is useful, describes why we need to regroup inbox, why we don't want to manually group it...
 - TDT evaluation: New Topic detection and topic tracking.
 - Performance metric: precision, recall, FP, FN, TP. FP and FN forms a DET curve.
 - Data: not Enron, data collected by their own, at ETH Zurich,	created_at : 1453950908.0,	issue : 4,	updated_at : 1453950908.0
